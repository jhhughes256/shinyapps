This simple Shiny application demonstrates `fixedPage` UI with a grid layout
using `fluidRow` and `column`. The application has basic reactivity, where
the inputs provide the parameters required to represent the Michaelis-Menten
equation rendered as `output$mmPlot`.

**THIS IS AN EXAMPLE APPLICATION AND IS FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.**
