This Shiny application demonstrates conditional UI using the `conditionalPanel`
function. By changing the distribution type, `input$disttype` different inputs 
become available. These inputs are used to generate the figure showing the shape 
of that distribution, `output$distPlot`.

**THIS IS AN EXAMPLE APPLICATION AND IS FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY.**
