# SERVER - Example of using the plot brush with interactive plots

# sub.cyl is located in global.R and is the unique values for the column you
# plan to subset your data by

    mtcars[mtcars$cyl == sub.cyl[rv$n], ]
  )  # Rdata()

# Plot the subsetted data
# The plot is just a regular plot unless made interactive in ui.R
# Rdata() is used as if mtcars was used, it is possible to highlight points
#   that are not on the screen!

    }  # otherwise
  })  # renderUI

# Use the left and right buttons to cycle through the plot subsets
# Do this by using obsereEvents that change what part of the subset is next
